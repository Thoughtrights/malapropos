Lists of inappropriate words.

Coverage for:
* English (en)
* Spanish (es)
* French (fr)
* German (de)
* Dutch (nl)

## Organization

Word lists are segmented out by generally into three buckets:
1. `inappropriate` words and phrases under most common circumstances
2. `situationally` inappropriate words and phrases or sometimes just mild
3. and for English, a grab-bag of to-be-determined words

Depending on the context, many words in the `inappropriate` list are
instead situationally appropriate and vice-versa.

Comments accompany the non-English word lists to give context for some
users. These appear on the same line as the word and begin with a `#`.

At the time of this commit, across the five languages I covered, there
are 1,170 words in the inappropriate lists and 486 words in the
situational/mild lists.

## Known Caveats

This does not attempt to be a complete dictionary with all textual
permuations. Cases of substituting numbers for letters and variations
of acutes and umlattes is left as an implementation exercise.

All words are lowercase latin.

German makes use of English swear words and treats them with very
little sensitivity. e.g.- "Fuck" is commonly heard in television
commericals.


## Apologies & Disclaimer

I'd like to apologize in advance for ... many things. I am not a
linguist and have limited vocabulary in anything other than English. I
am certain there are plenty of mistakes. I have a limited purpose for
this and a specific context for this which shaped decisions as to
where a word fell (inappopriate vs situational). Your use will not be
the same and these should only be a starting point.

Lastly, I'd like to apologize to anyone embarrassed or offended by the
content. The intent of releasing this openly is to lessen the effort
of a developer going foward.
